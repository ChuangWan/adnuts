Title: No-U-Turn MCMC Sampling for 'ADMB' and 'TMB' Models
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Cole", "Monnahan", email = "monnahc@uw.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Bayesian inference within R using the no-U-turn (NUTS) algorithm by 
 Hoffman and Gelman (2014). Designed primarily for 'AD Model Builder' ('ADMB') models,
 but also works for any posterior whose log-density and log-density gradient
 can be written as R functions. This includes 'Template Model Builder' ('TMB')
 models but also other special cases. Functionality is similar to software 'Stan', 
 and tools from the 'rstan' and 'shinystan' packages are used for diagnostics and 
 inference.

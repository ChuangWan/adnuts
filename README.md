# adnuts
An R package for NUTS sampling for ADMB and TMB models

For now, install using:

````devtools::install_github('colemonnahan/adnuts', build_vignettes=TRUE)````

The package contains a user guide: `vignette('adnuts')`. This will help get you started.

For a demonstration on a real model, see example code in the inst/demo.R file.

To use the ADMB functionality you need to use version 12.0 (released
December 2017) or later, otherwise this functionality is not available.

# adnuts
An R package for NUTS sampling using TMB and ADMB

This package is still in development, but is fairly stable. I will be submiting to CRAN hopefully in Ocotober, 2017. For now, install using:

````devtools::install_github("colemonnahan/adnuts", ref="master")````

This code comes with no garuantees and will change over the next few months.

To try fitting your own models, see example code in the inst/demo.R file.

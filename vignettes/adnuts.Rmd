'adnuts' main purpose is to provide a wrapper for performning Bayesian analyses using the NUTS algorithm for ADMB models. The ADMB model itself contains the algorithm code, but this package provides the user a convenient environment to run and diagnose Markov chains, and make inference. In addition, NUTS capabilities are provided for any posterior whose log-density and log-density gradient can be written as R functions. This includes TMB models but also other special cases. 

Key features of the packages:

- Run no-U-turn sampler or random walk Metropolis MCMC chains from within R
- Parallel execution and automatic merging of chains to ease the workflow
- Diagnostic checking using functionality provided by `Rstan` and `shinystan`
- Mass matrix adaptation is available, or a dense matrix can be passed
